## My process

### Built with

- CSS Flex
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
```js
x = 3;
const randomFunction1 = () => {
  return ++x;
}

const randomFunction2 = () => {
  return x++;
}
```
randomFunction1 and randomFunction2 would not produce the same results,
function 1 increases the value before it is returned, function 2 returns the value then increases it.
